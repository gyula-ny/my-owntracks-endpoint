# my-owntracks-endpoint
my dead simple HTTP endpoint for Owntracks - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.owntracks.android

This is a http server that listens for POSTs by the Owntracks app. It saves the records in mongodb.
(Also, a personal experiment to see how much fun it is to write code with eslint-plugin-fp enabled. The result is none).
